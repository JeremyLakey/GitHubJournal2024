Mar 30th,

I showed off the recipe parser, and I'm getting a lot of positive feedback.

Like people actually want to use it. So I moved it to it's own repository.

So I might take more time to work on it more fully. 

Today, I worked on a bug I found with a new recipe. Eventually, I might start structuring some more things. 

Instead of a webpage, I think I'm going to make a discord bot that takes a url and type. Then sort new recipe in a private git repositories.

I'm think about making a table of contents that gets updated with each new recipe in it sub types. 

Big plans, but I got to figure out a few things.

-Discord bots
-Updating repositories from the program
-Making a python api
-Hosting

But I have done very similar things before.

Bye!
