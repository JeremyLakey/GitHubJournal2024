Mar 21st,

I don't have much time tonight, but things are somewhat progressing still.


I added some error throwing for improper use of the api.

There are some other errors I could add, and I might.

Really need to eventually do this documentation thing.

I watch season 3 of Dr. Stone. (It was a bop)

Bye
