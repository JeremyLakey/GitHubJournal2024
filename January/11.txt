Jan 11th,

Started learning Godot today.

Unity betrayed us, so guess it is time to start from zeroish.

I don't hate how it is going so far, but I definitly miss the comfort I developed on 2 game jams on unity.

Things always feel backwards starting a new frame work/engine. I'm suprized somehow ever time a new language seems just like a python clone.

Which is what the godot scripting language seems like.

But I just added input, but the project will completely change into a blocky tower defense game in the coming months.

Since Godot script and the tools are the newest, I will definitly have slower results.

I just added a second page to the website called about me.

That is all
