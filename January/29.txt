Jan 29th, 

This is the day that I released my first npm package.

I released a node.js terminal package that I'm using for mudcraft.

Currently, haven't tested most of it, but mudcraft has been flying by.

It crazy how much I've wanted to work on this, but I just couldn't crack input blocking.

But now I figure that out, the rest is falling into place.

So for mudcraft, I'm working on getting the displays working.

Instead of build it as fast as possible, I'm architecting it a little more.

I'm making a system that allows for different displays types and commands.

After adding movement and displays, I'll be working on mining, crafting, and lastly attacking.

That will hopefully be the mvp. I might show this to a minecraft youtuber I know from college.

But lets get it working first.

I take my leave for the night
