Mar 16th,

Turning machine example api is                functional finally.

Half of the problems were the api and the other half was the bot.

So it took me a minute longer than I would lllllllllllllllllike to admit.

I think I'm gonna expand the api include the stats things and add it to the example bot.

Then release the api as a node module.

But                 I'm excited to see this project coming to an ennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd.

You might notice a bunch of mistakes in this log. That is my keyboard.

I'm leaving those in to show my paain.

It is really bad. I                  Think thhis is inferiating.

But that is it for today.

I need ttttttttttttttttto start brain storming new project ideas to pivot to

laters
