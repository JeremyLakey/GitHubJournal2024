May 27th,

So I got some inspiration for a twitch plays project. 

Twitch plays clash royale!

Basically a set up that will allow a bunch of twitch chatter to somewhat play clash royale from their twitch chat.

I've already got the most important part of the game, emotes, working.

Somewhere I got twitch chat reading perfected. I just have to go back and find it.

It shouldn't be that hard of a project. But I'm just very excited for it to get off the ground.

Bye
