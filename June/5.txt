June 5th,

I'm feeling very tired today. I waited a little longer than usually to start coding.

And I felt it. I was playing tetris, so my brain was active enough to almost give out.

Then the one attack function I wrote almost caused the brain structure to give away.

I would've lost everything I knew. 

But luckly, my brain's smoothness deflected such a pressure.
