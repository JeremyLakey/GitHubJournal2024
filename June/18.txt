June 18th,

This week, or the last 4 day, have felt more stressful than I would like.

I'm going to try to think about why and get back with an answer tomorrow.

There might be a word vomit session, but I just need to check in.

Today, I did a leetcode problem. 

It was interesting. 

It was basically combining a large number of segments of undeterminded length and colors.

So I hashed map the beginning and ends and iterated until the end.

Overall, It worked fine.

I wonder if there is a hard based off this medium problem.
