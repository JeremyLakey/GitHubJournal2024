Jan 26th,

I made a simulation for a game called bank.

The result of the simulation was interesting. 

It seems like you want to wait more. And the more you wait, the higher your point total will be in the long run.

But that doesn't take into account the game situation. I might run 
another simulation to see win rate.

But I was helping my wife learn how to code, so I'm actually putting in effort into a project I cannot git commit.

But laters.
