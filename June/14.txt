June 14th,

Grandma died today.

We've know about this certainty since last month.

So no shock.

But some waves.

Honestly doing better than you might expect.

Going to hang out with my family more this week than usual.

And I'll likely get more time to program.

Today, I work on clash royale project some more.

Mostly done I think.

Next up is actually tesitng the dang thing and looking for bugs.

Oh, and screen shoting every card in the game.

Bye
