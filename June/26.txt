June 26th,

So I updated my work computer os version today, but my backup did not complete properly.

This will set me back weeks mentally.

That all resulted in me having less motivation.

So rock bottom, but I ended up enjoying myself coding today.

It was pleasent debugging.

Noticing lots of little things going wrong with the CR project.

But I'm making great pace.

At this rate, I'll probably have it done by next week.

Out
