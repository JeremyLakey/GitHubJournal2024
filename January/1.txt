Welcome to my git hub coding journal for the year 2024!

I'm writting this as a log of my learning and hoping to keep it up through the year.

Lets discuss what projects I would like to do.
 
1. A website that talks about this journal
 
2. A text interface to minecraft

3. Mods for lethal company

4. Interview problems

I don't have any order or reason to what I'll work on.

But I would like it to be cool and teach me something.
