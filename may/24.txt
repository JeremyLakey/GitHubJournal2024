May 24th,

The world is a very confusing and confunding place.

But sometimes the coding just feels good. Did a bit of refacting today on mudcraft.

All of it in preparation for having others potential work on the project.

So I updated the read me.

Actually use a scr directory.

And made credientials and settings more centeral.

So nothing new feature wise, but this work will help the project move along.

I'm really happy working on this project.

The feeling is very encouraging and motivating.

I haven't talked about motivation as much in these logs lately.

Motivation has been pretty steady at this point.

I have a large project to work on, and I'm making enough project to feel happy about each day.

There really isn't any day were All I do is code, which is very different from the start of this journey.

Instead, I do the bare minimun each day. Partly because my family life has been much much busier. 

So I really can't work on this project more than 30-60 minutes a day.

In summary, I do be coding. It might not be a lot, but it's honest work.
