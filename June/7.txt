June 7th,

I'm been very busy these last few days. Cars water pump went out, wife launcher business, kid got a tooth.

A lesson I think most programers can learn from is write down your thoughts. Take time to write as you work.

I've been doing this at work this last few weeks.

It helps identify blockers. 

It helps refine your ideas

And your thoughts slow down to a nice pace that is coherent.

It can also be fun enough to replace the dopamine of looking at your phone.

Human brains hate boredom. Writing gives more beautiful engagement to stimulate away boredom.

Bye
