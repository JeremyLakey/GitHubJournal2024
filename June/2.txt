June 2nd,

Yesterday I didn't get to talk much, but today has issued me more time.

Used a lot of time to work more on parsing stuff for the clash royale bot.

Kinda doing everything at once. So it is weird to say, I got half of battling and editting deck, but I also refactered this over here and this over here.

But I like the progress that I'm going at.

It's kinda slow, but working everyday is having it's upsides. I'm constantly making something I find cool.

This whole experience has been awesome. Last month was slower, but I think I still made great progress on mudcraft, the recipe parse (I believe that was this month) and found a new project to focus on. Also all the unreal engine learning.

The gmtk game jam was announced, so it is time to train. And also train some recruites to join me.

Alright, night
