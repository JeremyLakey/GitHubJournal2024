Happy Friday!

Started working on tests for turning machine. I might only do a few tests a day, so it will likely take a while.

In other news, I started watching godot tutorials.

That is why in terms of actual time spent coding, there was less.

But more time overall spend on the project. I didn't add anything to the godot file today.

Godot overall is very simple, but some times it just is weird.

It's own scripting language is both python and javascript like.

It has some form of type safety, but it doesn't require you to invest in it.

Instead of a list of game and sub game objects, everything is a scene.

Meaning you can load just about anything as a scene, but obviously you don't load enemies as a scene.

The structure of scenes seems to work almost like a file tree. With the tutorial using get_node('../../someobject') to select stuff. (The .. is a folder/node above.

Overall, there seems to be closer tooling with the script. Making connecting the script to different callbacks easier. 

Enjoy your three day weekend
