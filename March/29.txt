Mar 29th,

Had a lot of fun today writting the scrapper some more.

I got it kinda down to pretty high quality.

I decided to write to md so that I can better format the instructions.

Eventually, I'll probably have a private git repo that my family can add ingredients.

I might even make a server with a webpage that we can submit urls to and it automatically uploads to the repo.

I know, it sounds crazy. But it would be dope to centrialize this.

Either way, this project has been incredibly useful to learn.

Bye!
