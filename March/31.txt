Mar 31st,

The last day of march.

A lot has happened this month. And I'm pretty happy.

Last month I was considering stopping. Looking back, I'm going at a nice pace now.

So today, I was just writting documentation and exporting the bot-client for the Turning Machine project. 

I basically just have to write the last bit of documentation for using the client now. And some formatting of the other .md files.

I'm trying to take it off my plate before I forget.

It might be my main project that I show off for jobs. It really has it all.

Bye!
