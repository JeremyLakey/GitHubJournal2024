Jan 18th

I uploaded a new project. I did start it a minute ago, like 3 months ago.

So the new project this week is a text based interface for minecraft.

My main struggle is figuring out how to handle input and output 
simultanously.

But I found someone who ran 3d graphics using node's terminal. So i'm confident in the output.

Today was more of a research day, but I think I'm gonna move back to the other projects for now.

Bye!
