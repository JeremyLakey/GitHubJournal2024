May 18th,

I've been sick today, so I took to enjoying the simplist of pleasures. Soup.

A good soup is hard to beat when you have a sore throat.

I believe it is just the common cold, but onto coding stuff.

Mudcraft stuff today. I'm trying to revamp some things.

Firstly event history stuff. Just labeling typing and stuff.

In the next few days, I plan on revisiting display stuff.

Hopefully, then I can start on more extensive commands.

Bye!
