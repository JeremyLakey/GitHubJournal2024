Feb 17th,

The pool at our vacation location was probably 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It hurt my hands to keep them under water.

But I updated the levels guide to include level 3. Definitely going to keep updating that as I learn more and more.

Also played the game Heat for the first time. It was a good game, but we were all learning. So it wasn't close.
