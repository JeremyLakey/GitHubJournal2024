June 4th,

If thou art consuming this with thy sight orifices, by now yee knowth truly me.

Logs of the day contain rarely a thing that stimulates the intellectual aspects of the mind.

Sham, really. 

This hour, of this day, I elected myself to produce words of a higher caliber. 

Words that shall go down as highly esteemed. All to assimulate in the hearts of men and women, a feeling of worth and purpose.

Soon thy brains shall assemble the pieces of my madness. Of my words.

And soon yee rue the time spent consuming.

Furthermore, my hands built a calibration function in for the clash royale project.

Emotes shall auto calibrate the correct coordinates into a file at the click of a program.

Nevertheless, the day is spent. 

I retire
