Mar 4th,

Working on a new desk, so writing guides and the log from my journal today.

It was a pretty nice Monday. I was debugging at work for way longer than I will admit.

But it was a strange bug. Tests were failing outside of my changes, because I mocked something and added to a list of mocks. This cascading affect had weird side effects that are hard to explain.

But all tests passing now.

My new desk is pretty cool and we are custom making it our self to slide perfectly into our walls.

So It hopefully will have a positive impact on this project. Therefore I'm mentally counting it like time spent on the journal. 

Bye bye
