June 9th,

Planned on doing something simple today. 

And it was even simplier than I originally planned.

I made a function to solve the game towers of hanoi.

I remember seeing this function like 4.5 years ago.

And I didn't understand it then, but I wanted to implement it.

Most of the time was spent trying to mental translate the solution.

I started by practicing myself a few smaller examples.
'
Then I realized that it is just calling three functions recursively over and over again.

Those functions being.

Move tower of height - 1 to pivot position.

Move final block to target position.

Move tower of height - 1 form pivot to target position.

It's not a very efficient solution, but I'm pretty sure that the optimal solution is always 2^n - 1 moves.

So the solution will always be exponetial.

Alright bye
