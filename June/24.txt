June 24th,

So I felt much more motivated today.

I think the part of telling myself what I'm going to work on is very motivating.

More like, I'm in the habit. And the habit has less fiction when I preplan my next task.

I just released I did the wrong task. I was going to QA Clash royale project, but I instead did mudcraft...

Oh well. QA clash royale tomorrow instead.

Out
