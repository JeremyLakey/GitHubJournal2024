May 19th,

Got entities working for mudcraft. 

And it is quiet great to see things walking around.

Makes the whole game look and feel alive.

Well, I'm tired enough that I don't want to write any more.

But this week has been fun.

This mudcraft is probably my favorite project in this series.

I wouldn't be mad if I just worked on this for the rest of the year.
