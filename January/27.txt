Started teaching my wife how to code. So far, it has been good.

So, I've been coding for work, for a hobby, when I talk to my brothers, and now with my wife.

I'm not gonna lie, its a lot. But I think I'm improving.

Like, there is a lack of fear I once had.

It's like I just don't think as much, but more gets done. (Unless its godot)

Today I worked on some Turning Machine Api tests.

Then I updated the terminal tools, so the next set is to test the tools 
and make them an npm module so I can import it for mudcraft
