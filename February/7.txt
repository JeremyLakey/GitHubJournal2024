Feb 6th, Wait 7th,

So mudcraft is at the point were the player can move around the screen.

I need to adjust some values, but it loads the blocks and updates the screen.

It currently a height map, but eventually, I'm going to start working on getting all the blocks colored correctly.

I also need to add the entities.

But today is a landmark day in this project. I'm knee deep in debugging, but progress!

Maybe, by the end of the month, we can have full color and movement.

I'm guessing crafting is going to be a loooooooooooonnnngg while.

With lastly combat and equipment.

Until a day that is not today, but not two days from now, because that is too late for my git hub streak.
