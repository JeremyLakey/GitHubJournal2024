Mar 28th,

Still working on the parsing of recipe meta data.

Instead of grabbing just a section of code at a time, I'm trying to parse to json first then work from there.

There is some hardships with that thou.

Like sometimes there are arrays or graphs of more data.

Very much pain awaits as I slowly figure it out with more websites.
