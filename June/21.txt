June 21st,

I made burgers on the charcoal grill today.

Figured out that a little air flow hatch was closed, resulting in less air than required getting in.

Basically last lime was terrible, and this time worked like a charm.

Classic easy day of adding debug statements.

All in prep for actually testing the clash royale project.

One day. One day I'll wake up and just DO IT!
