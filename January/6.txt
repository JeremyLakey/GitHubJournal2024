Jan 6,

I had a little more time to work today, because it was saturday.

Personally, I feel more motivated to code this week, but I still anticipate lower levels during future weeks.

For a first week, this project has helped to reduce my fear of starting a project. 

Finishing a project is a different struggle. Probably partly because I haven't defined a done state for my projects.

I'm currently of the opinion that habit building is the first step. So I rather have a concidency with my work schedule than a finished project.

Eventually I'll get more goal oriented and focus on features.

I feel like there is a heiarchy of coding, just like the heiarchy of needs.

First is spending time coding. I'll have to figure out the rest later.

Bye!
