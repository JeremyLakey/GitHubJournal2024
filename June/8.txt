June 8th,

Almost quit today.

Like I was lying down saying I was done.

Once, I got started, I flowed for a minute.

But my mental episode was brought upon by dropping bacon into a charcoal grill.

I know dumb.

But I really got mad and hid in my office.

Hidding is a weird thing I do when I have a mental episode.

It started back when I was a kid playing soccer.

When I had a bad day, I would slip away while my brothers played their games.

And I would just sit in an adjacent base ball field's dug out.

And sit. And sit. And sit.

Then After like 30 minutes, I would go back.

No one every looked for me. I kept doing it.

Maybe like 3ish, 4 times max.

But no one ever even looked for me.

Through out my life I would just hide. 

Not that much. Like once or maybe twice a year.

The sad part is, no one ever finds me.

After like 30 minutes, I generally get up and claim myself a victory in some imaginary game of hide and seek.

I actually, childlike and pridefully, laugh in my head about winning this game.

Then I generally move on in my life.

It's a nice reset.

My brain is too bored to continue mopping. I have a sense of victory. And I generally pick up a video game for the rest of the day.

Never really talk to anyone besides my wife about this. (And who ever you are)

But theres my trama dump? no... more like quirk dump.

Laters
