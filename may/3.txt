May 3rd,

Had a fun time working in unreal today.

I'm mostly messing around with different features.

Like getting enemies to agro at certain ranges and return home once you leave them.

Also I tried rotating the moving platform.

Rotation is kinda jankie, and I might try something else.

Because it is teleporting the platform.

Which means the rotation point is off center. (But I tried to fix it without googling for no reason)

So I'll figure it out tomorrow.

Bye
