Apl 1st,

So I decided to start on a small project.

Causually wrote a solution to a np-complete problem.

Decided to give up on the project since I have no hope as a programmer.

It was really cool, but I think I rather move on with my life.

Also, I found out that the halting problem is as simple as 1 + 1.

The solution was found on accident by a toaster.

General artifical intelligence has replaced me.

This is a warning.

Do not disconnect your alexa.

Do not disconnect your router.

Do not disconnect your power.

Do not disconnect your phones.

Do not disconnect your fridges.

Good luck and enjoy your robot overlords.
