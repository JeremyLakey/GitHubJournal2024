Mar 27th,

Today I decided to acctually start webscrapping for recipes.

Great thing about recipes, is everyone wants to appear on google. 

Which means they all use the same-ish format.

So, I'm like half way done after a few hours of looking into webscrapping.

I went with selenium, because it is what I found first.

And it is working. So I will likely have all my recipes locally stored within the week.

Bye!
