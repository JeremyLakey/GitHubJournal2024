May 6th, 

I'm gonna admit I feel stuck.

I don't want to go back to my old projects.

And learning feels rough.

My head doesn't like either reality.

But I'm going with learning unreal and doing a udemy tutorial I bought 2ish years ago.

It went fine, but a lot of time was spent updating things.

Bye~
