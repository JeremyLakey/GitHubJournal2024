Apr 9th,

Starting on a simple website for the recipe parser.

I might actually host the site and see if I can get users.

Or I just might ignore it and never get around to it.

Part of the reason I started working on a website again is that I fear it.

Most of my programming career I have actually done front-end related things.

It comes easy, but somehow I fear doing it from time to time.

So I decided to try and get the rust off.

Personally, I struggle feeling powerless with what I know sometimes.

But if I just do it, I feel relieved that I understand what I'm doing.

Overall, today was a little detor to make me feel nice. 

And it helped.

Bye!
