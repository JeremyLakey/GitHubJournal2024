Jan 7,

I worked only on the turning machine api today.

Moslty small clean up of a buch of a little sections and getting to the generation of games.

I'm wondering if I should schedule a time each week to work on a new project.

I'm concern with getting overly invested on one project and it crash and burning.

But working on different and new projects could reck the momentum I have build on a project.

So I think I will have a focus project and one to two side projects I try to work on each day.

For example, the website is the current side project and the turning machine api is the focus of the majority of my time.

I might change side projects more occasionally, and only change the main project once a monthish.
