Feb 10th,

Made some chicken wraps today.

And I wouldn't mention it if they went something.

We also got a type writter.

I'm very tempted to write on the type writer, instead of this.

But I'm committed.

Today, I started experimenting with color depth map instead of characters. (In mudcraft)

It is working well, but I need to start adding character for different blocks.

Then it will start to feel connected.

Movement and loading is all over the place. The loading seems to be off by one block, but that is a tomorrow problem.

Movement is probably what I'm going to solve last.

I think adding mobs also might make it seem look alive.

Good night
