Mar 14th,

I'm struggling to debug something today. Resulting in hours lost.

I'm fine with it, I'm sure to mention it when I figure it out.

Also, I'm working on something cool for work I will mention after it goes public. Which might now be for a while, but it is very delightful.

Goodbye.

ps. working very very late for a work deadline, so no progress on personal projects
