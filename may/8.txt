May 8th,

I have a really bad headache today.

Also, I'm going on a trip, so I will not be very active.

But today I worked on fixing the moving platform in my unreal game.

There were some rotation issues, so in true programming fashion, I advoid fixing the actual problem and came up with a different solution.

Instead of rotating the platform, I just multiple the movement vector by -1.

Problem solved.

Bye
