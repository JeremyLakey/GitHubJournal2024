May 5th,

Another day of teaching my brother coding.

We did some white board coding, which seems to go a little better than computer coding.


I also started with teaching with what was taught last.

I think it is important to start with something the previous lesson covered.

That way, the student has something to build off to.

Also, I think having real world examples.

Lastly, I try to get their reasoning as much as I can.

But we learned about scopes, functions, boolean, and loops.

Overall, a fun way to practice program is to teach others.

Bye
