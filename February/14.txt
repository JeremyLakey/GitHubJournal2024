Feb 14th,

V-day, so I'm making a dish that takes 4 hours. I worked a full day. Instead of achieving much tonight, we are gonna accept fixing a few tests.

I'm feeling like after this week, when I get free time, I'm going to take a day to actually program.

A kick in the butt to push me over the edge of small minimun changes into pushing myself again.

But This week is not that week.

Good day peeps!
