Apr 18th,

Working on the discord bot some more.

The structure is a little weird, because there seems to be a difference between a command and a slash command.

Also, there is a difference between running a client and a bot.

Either way, I'm tired. 

I think I've been slowly down lately.

There is a weird lack of gusto I have been having lately.

Errors seem weird and hard to debug.

Things are taking for ever for the smallest things.

The projects are still improving, but at a snails pace.

But a part of all that is learning new back-end tooling.

SLow things take a lot out of me.

bye
