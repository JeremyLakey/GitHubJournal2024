Feb 27th,

So I went to do a leet code problem, and my mouse glitched spammed the submit button. Which got my ip ban from leetcode.

Hopefully, this all blows over is a few days, but I might never know if my solution will actually work.

Which is sad, because based -2 was a really really fun problem.

This type of thing, getting banned for a random reason outside of my control, is very like me.

Back in minecraft in the early 2010's, I was falsely blamed and banned on a handful of servers.

Oh well, feel free to test my solution and roast it. It wasn't very thought out, because I have to go.

Bye
