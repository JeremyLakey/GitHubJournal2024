Jan 14th, 

Two weeks down!

That is almost 4% of the year!

Nothing much happened today, but I'm somewhat starting a small project to learn godot.

Instead of building my blocky game first, I'm building a basic vampire survivor like game.

I find programming something like vampire survivor generally teaches me how to use a engine, but doesn't require much more than a few hours.

Fixed a few errors I found in tests.

Onward to week 3!
