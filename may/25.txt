May 25th,

Was working on Mudcraft and was trying to fix an issue.

Basically light should be a thing.

So I looked into it and realized that light is not included in the model of the world.

They just never got around to calculating it. So I think tomorrow or the day after that, I'm going to implenet light on the open source project. Then use it in mudcraft.

Honestly super excited to work on it, because I'm totally wanted to work on something. And now that I found an issue that relates to me, I'm going for it. 

Bye!
