Apr 19th,

I'm happy that the weekend is now.

My work was stressful this week.

In other news, I took what I learned from working with the other discord bot and gave my Jerome bot a new place to speak.

Before I release Jerome on the world, I need to figure out a few things. 

1. How do I give Jerome goals?

2. How do I give Jerome actions?

3. How do I select what memories to load into Jerome?

4. How long should memories last?

Maybe I'll actually think about it and unleash a generial Artificial intelligence on the world.

Hopefully this doesn't turn into some horror log from the future where Jerome goes evil.

Good bye!
