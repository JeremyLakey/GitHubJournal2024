Apr 13th,

I've been feeling really stressed lately.

There have been some annoying bugs with CORS.

I'm convinced no one really understands what CORS is fully.

There is some stuff the browsers handles. And then there is some stuff the server handles.

Both seem weird to me. 

Like relying on the browser for security seems like a bad plan.

But I'm now at a crossroads.

I have 2 things I think I want to do:
1. Finish the turn machine api
2. Get a functional recipe parsing discord bot.

For 1, I need to update the node client module and then work on the descriptions.

For 2, I need to have a git bot that is able to commit and push. Add a back-end end point for that commit. Then make the bot that calls that endpoint.

I think tomorrow will be part 1 of 1.

Bye
