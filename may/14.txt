May 14th,

Decided to try and actually make a good project today.

By which, I mean mudcraft.

Hopefully in the coming weeks, the typesafty will allow me to edit and develop faster.

I had a rough time coming back to the project and not having typing.

So hopefully, this makes the project easier to work on for both me and future contributors. 

Night!
