June 11th,

Time is flying by.

I'm feeling so tired every night.

There has been some video ideas I have had that I wanted to create.

But atlast, I'm way to tired most nights.

It doesn't help that I code, cook, play tetris, play clash royale, and have a kid.

But I'm just being lazy I guess.

Ok, but real talk. I've been keeping busy.

Today I work on the clash royale project.

I'm very lost in the sauce, but I keep thinking of things to add.

Mostly all untested of course.

So I just hope it works when I eventually try it out.

But I'm very happy with the progress I do make, it just feels very slow and starting and stop each day is making the project drag. 

I just haven't had a free weekend to crank it out.

But whatever, I'm just lazy.

Bye
