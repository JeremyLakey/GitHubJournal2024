June 15th,

Over the last few months, mudcraft debugging has increasingly become a hard time.

So to counter this, I made some logging tools.

Then added them as hidden commands.

Most of my projects are at the testing stage.

But setup can be hard.

So I might spend sometime testing and writting stuff for a few days, but not actually getting to coding.

We'll just have to see.
