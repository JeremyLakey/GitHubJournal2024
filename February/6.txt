Feb 6th,

This might be my lazyiest day of the year.

A movie tonight is going to take up all my time from 7 to 12, and I still have to make dinner.

So I just solved a single leet code problem. And a very simple problem I once solved before in python.

I did it in javascript instead. It took a minute, because I make an array instead of a string.

And I confused myself.


Later tonight, if I have free time, I plan on researching running c++ in javascript.

Because it might be a better terminal output.

Never stop!
