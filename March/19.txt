Mar 19th,

Fixed the last of the endpoints for turning machine.

In theory, the project is fully functional. Both bot, api, and tests.

So the rest of the project should be writting documentation and readme.

And maybe publishing a node module of the api.

That might take some time, but next is the making more accomplishments on mudcraft.

It is time to start looking into fighting, placing blocks, and crafting. (So the game is completable.)

Goodnight!
