Feb 12th,

This week is really busy for me, so I'm committing to not committing anything hard.

Rather than spend the week making "meaning full" progress, I'm going to focus on busy work.

Like the last few tests for the turning machine api and some practice problems.

In the end, I think I can always progress something. Even if that is not progressing me dramatically.

I'm honestly so happy with my progress. Even if I stopped this project today, I would be proud of my progess.

Eventually, all practices and trainings stop progress. 

Getting better often requires a shock or pushing your limits.


As part of the practice problems, I'm going to write guides.

I think I'm going to do some of the following topics this week.

1. The levels of programming.

2. Why git is confusing.

3. Architecture and Teamwork.

4. UML and communicating flows.

5. Integration Engineering.

Bye!
