Jan 31st,

Ok, I'm trying a bunch of stuff to get the display looking good.

I might have to cut colors for the most part, because the performance is already slow

Today, I try reworking the system for displaying. Because colors are painful.

But nothing really is working. 

Hopefully, after getting displaying working, the rest of the project falls into place.

It won't, but I can dream.

Overall, great first month.

Till the next month
