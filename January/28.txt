Jan 28th,

Today I worked on the terminal project. But boy, I think I'm excited to release it.

I'll probably release v 1.0.0 of it tomorrow.

On another note, I think I'm not gonna do this project again next year.

We will have to see, but I think one year will be enough that I'll be happy with my programming skills.

After this, I want to look back and not recongnize the programmer at the beginning of the year.

Of course, I'll keep working on projects. And we will see if I accidently rope my self into maintaince and things.

But this year is ment to make my skills as a programmer solid and concrete.

And so far, I'm very happy with the pace of growth.

It's really the simple things that have the biggest impacts sometimes.

Week 4 is done. That is crazy. Less than 48 weeks to go.

Till next day.
