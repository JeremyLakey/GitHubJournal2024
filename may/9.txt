May 9th,

I'm litterally packing inbetween writing today's code.

Gonna be away from the computer for a few days, so expect less coding and more blabber about code.

Came back to mudcraft today. Don't know why, but it was about time to return.

Overall, I'm disappointed in how bad my code is and I'm considering transfering everything into typescript. It's just really hard to find data types that my functions are expecting.

And I only have like one or two objects....

Type safety is not just a net, but a productivity tool.

Bye
