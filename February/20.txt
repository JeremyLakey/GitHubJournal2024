Feb 20th,

I felt very unmotivated to program today. 

After soo much vacationing, I really didn't feel up to it.

The lack of motivation was weird. It was like I'm lost in all my projects and I don't know what to do.

Such a feeling is what I was trying to overcome by this project, so I'm happy to atleast do something about it today.

In order to get an easy win, I made a new project to prototype a game in the terminal.

I'm making it in python, because I'm going to translate it later into godot.

And the godot language is just pretend python.

The level of stress over this project currently is not healthy.

I don't know why I'm so stressed, but maybe I need to reset my brain.

Hopefully I'm write better and more optimistic things tomorrow!
