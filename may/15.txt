May 15th,

Gosh typescript rocks. 

I can right click on a function and get taken to were the function was define.

Instead of looking up documentation, I can just go to the module file and look at the definitions.

Literally going to save hours, plus it has caught a handful of bugs also. (I thought I was good enough to not make mistakes, but reality is often disappointing.)

Even though today was a tech debt day, it felt good.

I also learned a lot about how to use typescript.

Which is a great career skill.

Bye nerd
