Feb 3rd,

So I went to add a new bot type to my six nimmitz simulation.

And there was an error that should have been impossible.

That tipped me off that my estimating bot was adding imaginary cards to different piles.

Basically creating super piles of death that the other bots would generally trigger, because they make their decision before the bug.

After fixing that, the rate of success for the estimator bot went way way down. Like to a sad level of down.

But now the smartest bot is winning more, which is funny that a simple greedy algorithmn is winning.

Happy Saturday!
