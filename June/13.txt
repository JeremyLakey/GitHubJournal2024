June 13th,

It was almost friday the 13th,

But we will just have to settle.

TOday was a okay day.

I came home late, and it is bridgerton day.

So my programming time is negative 10 minutes.

So little time, but I actually made progress on the inventory view for mudcraft.

Eventually, you can actually use your inventory, but that will have to wait.

Bye
