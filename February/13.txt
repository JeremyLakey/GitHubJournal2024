Feb 13th,

I finished the tests today for the turning machine. Honestly, I was very afraid of running the tests.

So I made sure to run them anyways. Out of the 50 tests, we passed 32 of them.

Just an initial look into the error, it seems like they are failing do to an overload a variable/function I called count.

My I'm supposed to feel something resembling pride after all those tests. But I don't.

It needed to be done. So I did it. 

But I don't feel that great about the time I spend writing 187 tests.

Yeah, that is the final total tally of individual tests. This was a rare case where the project really needed all those tests.

Ok, I'm going to sleep after the final push through those tests!

No really you can go now
