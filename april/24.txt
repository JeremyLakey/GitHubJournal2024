Apr 24th, 

Today is the day I take the plunge into unreal engine.

So instead of going a little crazy trying to jumping into game making, like I did for godot, I'm mostly just listening to a video first and taking notes.

The plan is swap between watching a video for 20 minutes to actaully doing something each and every other day. Just so I don't pressure myself with too much.

The more time I put in, the more I demand of myself each day.

I think only going for 20 minutes will help stress stay low.

For godot, I might go back to it.

Honestly, I don't like unreal that much so far.

It seems like 3-D designers made a better and more powerful version of scratch that can take c++.

Call me elitious, but I kinda want to code my games. Especially if it is for a "coding" journal. 

But I don't know, maybe I'll change my mind the more I get into it.

Goodnight!
