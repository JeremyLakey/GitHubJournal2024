Feb 22nd,

Today was really rough for me.

I decided to stop playing clash royale, because it is a net negative on my life.

Part of the reason I stop was that the tatics of the game made it a chore to play.

Every day had mutliple mini challenges and side quests. 

And I noticed my time I spent programming went done, but my stress was going up.

So I uninstalled it after only 2 weeks.

But today I did the H-index leet code problem. I choose it at random, but it is on of my favorites now.

It has a good amount of edge cases, and takes some serious thinking.

But after a little thinking and a good amount of programming, most people should be able to get it.

Also the live action Avatar drop on Netflix today. I watch a few episodes, but I'm not sold.

Not going to get into it, besides one of my favorite characters was replaced with a plank.

Good knight to all the sirs and ladys
