Jan 21st,

So the first test I wrote for the turning machine api just generated a 100 games.

Then tested each game to make sure it only has one answer.

I forgot to delete the outer for loop after copying and pasting the first test.

So I was running each test 100x times.

Today was fixing that for the most part.

Also worked on the website. I literally just forgot about it for like a week.

My head is feeling better today. I can walk and stand more with out the flaring pain.

So hopefully that means my existential dread era is over for the year.

I've think this week went a lot better than I thought it would.

Learn godot is alright. Starting mudcraft again feels exciting and terifiying.

The turning project is in an mvp state. The goal for it this week is writing an example bot, adding a readme, and finishing the tests. (Only 28 more.....)

I might want to make a simple fetching leaderboard website also. I'm 
probably not gonna host it. Unless I have a coding competition I host.

Week number 3 is finished!
