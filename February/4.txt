Feb 4th,

I took it easy today. No reason.

Also I started much earlier, before even lunch time.

This was a strange experience, but hopefully the rest of the day is just that much more peaceful.

I worked on the turning machine api's tests, getting closer.

Next, I went back to godot and just added some ui before I had to stop.

Byeeeeee!
