June 17th,

Spent most of my day playing clash royale.

So for coding today, I decided work more on the clash royale project.

Very happy with the progress I made.

I implemented editting a deck, with scrolling, and some other calibration things.

I'm tired, and I'm going to do something with my night.

Bye
