Apr 22nd,

Today, I got the recipe parser, git util, and the discord bot all working together. 

Quiet magically to see it all come together. Now I just need to set up a few more features before I host.

1. I need to add a white list (So only select family members can access it).

2. I need to add the ability to sort the files into different catagories. 

I might even force users to pick a catagory.

Next up, I need to pick up more game development skills.

I plan on doing a game jam this year with my family. So I need to either learn Unity, Godot, or unreal more. 

I'm mostly trying to decide between Godot and Unreal.

Godot hasn't been bad, but it hasn't been great either.

There are some confusing things about how to do things.

I haven't touched unreal, but I know c++ pretty well. Enough that isn't a reason to not pick it.

Either way, I need to just focus on those skills instead of the standard programming I've been up to here.

Bye
