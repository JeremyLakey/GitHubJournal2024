Mar 20th,

Made some rad shrimp tacos tonight. Thought you need to know that.

I spent my time today cleaning up the api.

I'm pretty sure the rest of the work in now writting the documentation. (I cleaned up some rough patches)

So tomorrow will likely be documentation day!!!!


But I feel like I need to go read some documentation and practice learning something new.

For the most part, I have been doing stuff I know this last week. So there is a sense of fear about learning something new.

Bye
