Feb 2nd,

Add bots to 6 nimmitz project. 

Went really well. A monty carlo approach works really well, because you don't know what cards others have.

I have a few bots that had cheesy or random strategies, but the new bot doubled their win rate.

About 32% win rate to 15%ish from the other bots.



One hint about keeping a project journal like this, don't save it to the last minute.

It makes the whole process a drag and more anxiety filled.

So long until tomorrow, unless you are stuck in a time loop
