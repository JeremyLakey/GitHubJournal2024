June 19th,

As I stated, I will answer how to be happy.

Don't be sad.

Jk. 

I think is it too much of a broad topic to nail down in a single log.

But I think there are to haves of happiness.

Advoiding things that make you less happy and finding what makes you happier.

For example. Having a fire in your house will make you very not happy very fast.

But not having a fire will not make you happier.

While having a cookie will make you happier. But not having a cookie doesn't make you less happy, as long as you are fed.

Also, how much happiness things add/remove depends.

But that is all very transactional.

And I think we all know that is not all.

Generally most things give us happiness.

But most physical things seems to deminish in happiness return the more we depend on it for happiness. (Think to how you don't eat your favorite college meal any more)


Staleness is an important aspect to predicting happiness.

That is enough for today. I might continue this madness rambling tomorrow.

Bye
