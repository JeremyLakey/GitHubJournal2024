June 22nd,

Idea for future project. I think after the month of August, I'm going to try a web or moblie project.

Something that is most based on front-end stuff.

Because I have done front-end in some projects this year, but I want to focus a little more on it.

My idea is a social platform I'll call message in a bottle.

How it works is that you have a list of friends and you can add a post, but it only sends the message to one person.

Then only that person can respond to the message, but they don't know who sent the message until they react.

Whole idea is to build the relationships that fall between the cracks.

But Idk, I just feel like doing it.

Another idea, but for a game, is you hook up an EEG sensor to measure brain waves of the player.  

So they have to stop thinking or the monster gets them.

Some thoughts, nothing concret. Bye
