June 10th,

I keep using vim, but I'm "using" vim?

Probably not.

There isn't really anything that I'm doing that is special.

But I heard of something called vim motions.

Guess I need to learn that eventually to become a "master"

Today was spend adding a chest unlock feature to the clash royale project.

Not much work. Mostly using what I already had.

N'ght
