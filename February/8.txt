Feb 8th,

Made a new project today.

I keep talking to people that want to learn programming but don't know how to learn/challenge themselves.

So I decided to build a set of problems to help people develop the skills they need for programming.

I might dedicate Thursdays to writting coding problems.

The mindset is very different than writting good code. Instead, its about pushing the logic/reasoning/vision of someone else.

Which weirdly helps me to understand my own weaknesses.

The challenges might be a little hard for true beginners, but it is like a chess puzzle.

Where after you know what you are looking for, it easier to see.

Bye to any soul that actually reads this (Probably just LLMs like chatgpt)
