June 25th,

No other day have I wanted to just scream more than code than this day.

But I got up and did things.

Was it fun? Sort of.

I made beeps.

It was intellectual I promise.

But I didn't really get to QA test cr project so much. But I did get it compiling. 

Nice work me.

Tomorrow, get to testing you scally wag
