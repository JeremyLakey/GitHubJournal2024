Jan 24th,

I was trying to mess around with the terminal output today.

Got it somewhat working. The lesson I learn was clearning the terminal is really expensive.

So you have to cache the changes and only update those cells.

This probably wouldn't matter if I did the terminal in c++.

But it was interesting getting it to work in javascript.

The code may not seem like a lot, but it is a cumulation of experimenting and research.

But now I should have the tools to build mudcraft.

Laters!
