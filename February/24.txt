Feb 24th,

Do day I did two things that are scary.

First, I opened back mudcraft after not visiting it in weeks.

Second, I'm writting this log in vim instead of nano.

So there is very high chance I will lose this log by accidently typing the wrong command.

Hopefully my memory of vim returns after this log.

But for project mudcraft, I went ahead and started getting some more display stuff working. Then I started fine tuning the movement a little. (It still needs to be smarter about walking into doors, ladders, blocks)

Overall, today was a weird getting over a few hurdles of fear.

Laters!
