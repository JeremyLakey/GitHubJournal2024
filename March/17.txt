Mar 17th,

Starting working on some documentation today, but outside factors prevented me from making much progress.

It is crazy that I'm at this point. But I feel really proud of what this project has accomplished.

Like most projects on github are probably not functional unless they are school projects.

But turning machine api is functional.

Even more so, most don't have tests, examples, or documentation.

So this entire project feels very complete already.

But there is always more you can do on a project.

Signing out!
