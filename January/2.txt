January 2nd 2024

I think I have a rhythm for how I will do this journal.

Everyday I will work a little on the website. A font, a few word changes, and not much more.

Then I will work a little on another project.

I'm adding another project. 

It's the board game turning machine. I want to work on api that people can build bots on.

I would like to be able to host stats of different bots.
