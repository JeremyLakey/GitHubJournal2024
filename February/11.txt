Feb 11th,

Worked a little on mudcraft and laid the ground work for the entity displaying.

I might move the seperate color, background, and character.

A massive rework, but maybe it will help to identify the ground better.

Today is the "Big game". So I didn't have as much time to work on stuff today.

Ba bye!
