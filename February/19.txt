Feb 19th,

Got back today, but spend my night buying a new computer.

So my coding time is turned into computer set up time.

But I decided to do a leet code problem, and I got a sql problem. 

That was a new experience. But I learned about Left join, group by, and summary rows.

So it was more productive learning than I thought it was going to be.


But hopefully we get back to the reguarly programmed programming tomorrow.

THE END
