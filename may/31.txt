May 31st,

Last day of May.

Going strong today.

There are a lot of people over tonight, my significant other is doing a 48-hour film contest.

But I been able to slip away and work on the twitch plays clash project.

It's been nice to lose my self doing a personal project.

Can't remember the last time I felt like I was in the groove.

Honestly thou, the hard parts are mostly over now.

It's just doing simple things a lot of times.

Which is the perfect level of difficulty to get in the zone.

I'm going to keep working until June, bye!
