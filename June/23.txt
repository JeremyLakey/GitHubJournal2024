June 23rd,

Today, my computer has been commandeered by my wife.

So I'm not coding unfortunately. But I wasn't really in the mode anyways.

Instead I feel like ranting, talking, or expressing myself.

Motivation is at an all time low.

Just before the halfway point and I do not have much focus or driving force behind my coding.

Like I just do about 20 lines and move on with my night.

I don't think about what code I'm going to work on until the moment I'm free.

So it's more of a chore to figure out what is next before even working.

Maybe I need to plan more...

Or maybe I just need to start some smaller side projects again.

The clash Royale project is close to completion. So maybe I need to write up a read me for that.

But it's not motivating anymore. Which is fine, because most things lose their excitement over time.

But man, I'm not enjoying it.

On the flip side, I'm feeling very happy that I'm capable of pushing myself.

Ok so for the solution for this feeling.

First, I'm going to have a Quality assurance day. Where I don't necessarily code, but I look for bugs in a project I'm working on. 

I fine that I rather code most days than set up the testing environments for my projects.

Second, I need to start learning more unreal. So I will set apart two days to watching courses for that. (Which might involve code or not)

Hopefully I can be ready for a game jam by August. But it's all really whatever. Maybe I go crawling back to unity. Who knows.

Third, I'm writing my object for the next day on the day prior's journal.

That way, I don't have to worry as much about this throughout the day.

Fourth, I'm going to make a new file for project ideas. Nothing committal, but a list for new ideas.

For tomorrow: It's the first Quality assurance day. We are testing the clash Royale code.

Bye!
