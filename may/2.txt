May 2nd,

A bad habit I generally have when working on a "daily task" is the creeping to the deadline.

Like today, I waited to the last hour to start.

If I accidentally fell asleep, I would've missed my journal.

Which is sad to break a challenge after 120 days in.

But life is life. And I'm not doing well when it comes to getting this done.

I'm just struggling to find motivation and I switch between some smaller projects and learn.

Took some time today to mess around more in Unreal.

Bye
