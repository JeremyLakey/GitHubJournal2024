Mar 18th,

Learned today that body-parser is deprecated, so I removed it from the turning project.

Express comes with a .json() function that can be used as middle ware for parsing json bodies.

I also was making some headway on the api. (I got hold up on body-parser hanging because I forgot to add () to a function)

Most of the changes allow for stats.

Which might be helpful in the future. I'm thinking about making a webhook system (way down the line) that allows for tournaments. Each bot registers for an event and give an url. Then those urls get called when a tournament starts.

That is all I have to say on this day.
