May 12th,

Last day on vacation, so back to regular coding stuff tomorrow.

Probably the mudcraft project for most of the week.

Then maybe some more unreal learning.

Improvement and self care is a delicate balance. But I'm feeling better today.

I consider so much about giving up on this every time I go on vacation or a get away. This last one was the hardest.

But I desire consistency over perfection.

I'm very happy with the results of this project. I feel my ability to try new things has increased and my output has increased.

Even at work, I feel more level headed and consistent.
