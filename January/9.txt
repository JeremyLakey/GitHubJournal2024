Jan 9th,

Spent more time on Leet code 1093 than I would like to admit, but I did it in c++.

I'm actually very comfortable in c++. Not as much as python or javascript, but good enough attempt just about any problem.

What took me a second to figure out was why my answer was off by .00002. 

Turns out, floats lose more accuracy than doubles. Especially since floats have half the memory of doubles.


Instead of working on the main site or the turning machine, I looked into a testing frame work.

Jest seems simple enough, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't have any fancy features like mocking.

Luckly, I mostly want to test my rules.

I probably should have looked into testing routes, but I think having a large set of rules and game tests will suffice.

Maybe I'll test the entire route flow at the very end.

Until tomorrow!
