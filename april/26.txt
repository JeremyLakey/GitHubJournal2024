Apr 26th,

A quicker day, mostly focus on improving the recipe parsing discord bot.

Overally, I'm happy to say I included a whitelist. 

So know I can set it up that the bot only cares about what my family and I are doing. Maybe I need to look into making sure no can also take my username.

That's a future me problem.

Tomorrow I might go back to unreal engine.

Bye!
