Mar 8th,

I'm not sure what to talk about anymore while on vacation.

My son has a super adorable yellow duck swimsuit. So its awesome to flex his outfit

I'm wondering if setting aside one day a week would be more beneficial to this project. (instead of daily stuff)

I just kinda feel like I don't get into a grove much anymore while working on this. Never in a flow state.

But who knows.

I still feel like I'm somewhat improving at work anyways. So life is great.

Signing off
