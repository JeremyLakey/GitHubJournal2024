Mar 23rd,

Started a project to learn some ai. I'm starting with tic tac toe and might then move to black jack. 

It felt good to try something new, but at the same time, there is a lot to learn.

So starting small.


But tomorrow will be back to finish the documentation I have been working on.

Bye!
