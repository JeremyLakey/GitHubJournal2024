June 29th,

I've been debugging for a while.

Its really hard when it is kinda wishy washy stuff.

This is for the clash royale project.

But finding a card's position is kinda hard. Some cards are clicking in the wrong area.

Finding a general confidence level might've been a little ambitious. I might either have specific areas preassigned to look for cards or manually find the best confidence levels for each cards.

Tomorrow, I'm probably going to write a read me doc for this project.
