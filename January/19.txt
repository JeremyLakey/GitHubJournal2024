Jan 19th

I had a bad headache today, so I only worked on the turning machine. 

A few nights ago, I only got a few hours of sleep. With the added stress of work, set the stage for a decent headache.

It has last since I woke up. Nothing, including napping, medicine, or water has helped.

So what I committed today is just what gonna be what it's gonna be.

I don't feel burn out. Actually working on coding was relaxing, which is weird.

But it is what it is.

Until the dread of missing a day brings me back, good bye
