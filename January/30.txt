Jan 30th,

Worked on the terminal tools and mudcraft today. Mostly debugging trying to get the first display working.

I also did a leet code problem that required xor and preprocessing. 

Overall, I'm getting fraustrated with terminal output, but in a good way.

In a way the motivates me to keep hitting my head on it.

30 days down. And I can I feel a difference in my coding confidence.

I can't say I'm better at coding necessarily, but probably.

Other aspects of my life have fallen out of balance, like cleaning.

So this journal isn't without sacrifices and tradeoffs. But I'm happy with my progress.

I highly encourage programmers to work on something every day.

Coding is hard and long, but making a habit makes the hardest part not matter.

That part is starting. Atleast that is how it was for me.

The other hard thing is learning.

And overcoming failures and set backs.

There is just a lot of hard things in programming.

Bye until a day after today
