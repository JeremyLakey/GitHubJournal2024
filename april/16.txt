Apr 16th,

Got started on the discord bot, with a goal to have a recipe parser bot done by the end of the week.

In other news, I have a new mentor that might start teaching me some more vim.

Which I look forward to become a boss VIMer.

Learning a new set of integration tools generally take a minute to make sure everything is safe and correct.

More likely than not, this bot is going to become a security issue.

So, I'll have to be careful.

Bye
