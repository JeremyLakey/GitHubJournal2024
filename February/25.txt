Feb 25th,


Something is going weird with my computer. 

I got a new mouse and keyboard, but they are causing some strange bugs. 

So if there are random characters, I'm going to keep them in.

Just for demonstrative purposes.

But most of my day was spent trying to code, but fighting my mouse/keyboard.

Very fraustrating, but atleast I'm not maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad at my self.(See it randomly decided to throw in a bunch of a's)

Some how, my mouse and keyboard froze vs code................. (Again, repeating .'s)

I'm giving up for now and gonna research tomorrow.

Be gone
