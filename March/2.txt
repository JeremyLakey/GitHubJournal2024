Mar 2nd,

Today, I spent more time writting a sci-fi short story than coding.

So time well spent. But I enjoyed my Saturday. 

Moving to coding, I wanted to start working on the inventory system for mudcraft.

So far, I have the base of the code done. It just doesn't work.

Like, I thought it would. But it didn't. So I need to figure it out.

Nothing is showing up, and I don't know why.

Side story, this week at work I was debugging an endpoint for two days.

By the end I discover a setting that return false for an account when it should have been true.

I turned the setting on and off and it worked. Some migration must have been bad for local development. **cries in pain**

Happy weekend
