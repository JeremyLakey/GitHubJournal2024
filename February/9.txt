Just worked on mudcraft today.

Getting movement feeling a little better. But of course their is a lot of things to figure out.

For now, the display of the world is probably more important.

The first glitch I need to handle is the bugging height map.

I think I'm gonna have shades of grey for height. (Instead of shape)

That way, two pieces of info get communicated.

But I need to think about this much much more.

Each update is exciting, but this is definitely my longest planned project of the year.

The day is done, and this journal entry is so too.
