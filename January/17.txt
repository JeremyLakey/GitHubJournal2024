Jan 17th, 

Today was a little hard to get started.

I dreaded working on the godot game for some unreasonable reason.

But I had a moderate amount of fun. My code is unorganized and sloppy, but I'm getting faster.

Taking time to learn something is dreadful, but generally not bad after starting.

There is a lot I don't get about godot, but it is very simple. In a good way.

I'm keeping tonight simple since I had to watch the nolander.

Till the sun raises agian
