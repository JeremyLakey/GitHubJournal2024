Apr 21st,

Today I was feeling unmotivated. 

I think there is a part of me that feels down at work at the moment.

There is something I can't solve.

Nothing is really helping, including asking others for help and stuff.

But to fight this melancholy, I decided to do a leet code easy.

One I've done before, but this time in scala.

And boy, it took a minute longer, but gave a weird since of confidence.

There is not much I honestly like about scala, but it is what I do for work (80% of the time).

Honestly impressed that I actually got it to work. And since no one else has ever done that problem in scala, I got 100% percentile on both memory and run time.

So kinda a flex.

On to more important stuff tomorrow
