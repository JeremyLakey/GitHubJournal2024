Jan 8th,

We made it to week two!

So I took some time today to write a little schedule down on the unpublish website. We'll see if it holds or if I will remove it.

I put down I am streaming. I probably add my twitch link later, but the channel is called personman61. I only plan on stream on Saturaday for now.

On a more relevant note, I finished game generation for the turning machine project.

Next step is definitely adding a lot of tests for the rules. 

I'll need to look into a testing frame work for javascript.

Lastly, I added a footer on the website. Nothing crazy, just my name and a git icon. 

Overall feeling great.
