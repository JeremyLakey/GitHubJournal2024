Getting into the groove of things.

I felt I had lower motivation today after work, so I decided to work on getting the mongo database working

It took a minute longer I like to admit, but I got a few schema's done, established the connection, and got a basic post route working.

I didn't work on the website today, but it feels like I put more than enough effort.

Tomorrow I'll add salt and hashing to the passwords, and if I get to it, I'll make a JWT token for authenication.

That should enable most of the routes to have basic security, so I can focus on the game logic.
