Mar 25th,

Today a wrote a command for window's cmd.

I was always annoyied that there was no easy command to open a new terminal at the current location. So I made "newt" for "new terminal".

Nothing special, just a one liner.

I wrote more docs, which lead me to realize that stats return id's and extra not needed stuff. So I scrub the stats a little more.

Also, I think I have an idea for a project. Specifically, I want to make a website that uses chat gpt to parse cooking recipies. Dumb as it sounds, websites are the worst part about cooking.

I could just get ad blocker, but I think I want to centralize my recipes. Because I almost lost a recipe because it was taken down.

That is all, bye!
