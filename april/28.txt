Apr 28th,

Man ooohhh man, we are almost at the end of month 4.

This month feels slow and fast. 

My hobby code slowed down I spent more time learning about discord botting, unreal, and python servers.

Of course a healthy dose of CORS issues slowed me down and increase my ever growing anxiety about my ability to solve simple server issues.

But we worked through that. And now we have some fun stuff.

My recipe parsing discord bot is basically finished, besides writting documentation. (Just a MVP)

But that is fine.

On the other hand, I wrote a interesting memory system for an ai and connected it to discord. (Maybe JEROME will take over the world. Who wouldn't want that for thier coding baby they whipped up in 2 hours)

Jk. I will never put enough money into project Jerome to test his potential.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I did finish the turning machine project.

Literally the most "done" thing I've ever "done"

For today, I just watched over an hour of a Unreal engine tutorial. Learning is sllllloooooowwwww. But I'm bring my significant other along for the ride.

I'm hoping this is a back-door into convincing her to try coding again.

Blue prints is very interesting, and not super straight forward (While also being very straight forward).

Like to delete a connection, you alt + left click. (Or right click and select the disconnect option)

I'm sure lost in the sauce, but there is only so much sauce in the world.

But this is game time before summer game jams start popping up.

Bye!
