Apr 17,

Today made a supporting util for the recipe parsing api.

It can commit and push files.

So basically I have an api that can parse and now write files to an api.

Next up is hitting this from the discord bot.

I'm angry today. Don't have any reason.

Just don't know why and I wanted to mention it.

Somewhat stressed today about when I was going to be able to code.

But I'm feeling better that I got something coolish down.

It's weird to run the git script and see the updates to git hub.

Anyways, good night
