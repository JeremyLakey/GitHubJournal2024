May 1st,

New month, so I decided to do something quick today.

Did a leet code medium in scala. 

It was simple, because it was a dfs tree traversal.

Which is like scala's functional purpose.

To call functions that call functions.

I've been slowly slowing down.

Hopefully this is just the right pace from here on till the end of the year.

Which as long as I improve my skills and finish projects, I'm okay with that.

As of now, I feel my skills leveling up slowly but surely.

I'm more comfortable with learning and risky projects.

So, I'm happy.

This marks the 1/3 mark of this jouranl.

Bye
