June 20th,

Ok to finish the happiness discussion, I think that things that add to happiness in the long run are not physical, but in how people interrupt the world.

Meaning, by changing ones outlook in the longer term, there is a higher baseline happiness a person experiences.

For example, if you view your life as a blessing, your toast falling butter side down is not ruining the rest of your life.

But if you view things negetively, then that toast is the universe against you.

Don't know if I'm making much sense, but I had to be quick today.

I got another project I'll never mention again to start working on. (None coding)

Bye:w
