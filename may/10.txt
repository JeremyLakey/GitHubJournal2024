May 10th, if your following my GitHub, you noticed I forgot to commit. saddest of days. I'm kicking myself.

It 6:03 am here

I want to throw my phone.

I want to hit my head on the wall.

But I have one save bg grace I guess. We can pretend this channel takes place somewhere over the Pacific maybe? I don't know. I'm really really mad right. Now.


Also to add salt to the wound. I just found out my grandma has a month or so to live.


I just woke up and remembered to do my programming.

I was trying to catch up on sleep by going to bed earlier. because my child has been waking me up early and earlier. 

But generally brain doesn't remind me to do this until 10 pm and going to bed on vacation at 9 pm isn't a great idea.

Yours truly has failed after 4+ months.

bye (never before has the project been at risk like this)
