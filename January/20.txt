Jan 20th,

So I have a positional headache. Meaning I cannot sit up without a throbing pain.

Pretty bad things it could be. Like a tumor, or a small leak of the spine.

So I'll go to the doctors tomorrow or Monday if it doesn't go away.

Hopefully, according to some sites, it can heal after a decent amount of bed rest.

So hopefully it is minor enough and nothing serious.

But their is a chance this year is it. Which is funny somehow to me.

It must be the part of my brain that experiences existential deard.

Well, I'll be coding still.

I worked some more on the routes today. Did no testing, but in theory, the turning machine api project is MVP.
