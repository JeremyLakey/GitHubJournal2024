Apr 6th,

This was the faster turn around for a journal.

But I'm pulling an all nighter. So there might be more code to code, but I might forget to write this log later.

I have spent the last 30 minutes trying to access the chat gpt api.

Unfortunately, my card is not working on their site for api credits.

To rub salt into the wound, they took my money when I mistakenly signed up for chat gpt plus. (Which I originally thought was for api access, 20 clams gone)

I'm going to cry and maybe code some more:bye!
