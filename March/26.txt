Mar 26th,

I wanted to get more done tonight, but things got carried away.

So, ai documentation I feel like is really bad.

Or maybe it is just me.

But I went to read things, and they have so much boiler plate code that I learn nothing.

It's like copy and paste, then mess with the numbers until it works.

Adapting to my model, even a simple one like tic tac toe, is not obvious. 

But maybe I will change me mind about it after I finish it.

There is a part of me that wants to just make the ai libraries from scratch using c++. But I have resisted the urge up to this point.

But if I don't make progress in like a week, then I just might.

Night!
