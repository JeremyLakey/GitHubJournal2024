May 11th,

Writing this feels like I'm lying to myself.

Iissed a day and I've been avoiding the feeling. But deep down I still feel dumb.

But the coding lesson today is reframe a failure, because you define what failure is when learning.

So if you fail, you can reset and redefine it.

I'm gonna keep going and just accept the 99% success rate for the journal.

bye
