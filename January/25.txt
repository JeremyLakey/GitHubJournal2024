Jan 25th,

Went back to godot today to work on a paralax menu. I have an idea for a game.

But its going to be a minute, because child and godot.

Which is kinda sad I can really only work on code for like 30 minutes.

Slowly he is going to get more mobile, so it's gonna be an arm's race to distract my child.

I also worked on a few tests for the turning machine. Almost half way done with the tests.

Yip yip, till the morrow
