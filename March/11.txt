Mar 11th,

I'm not sure why, but I had no motivation today.

But I did some work debugging my example bot, and made it a little better of an example.

Overall, I'm fine with my effort of today.

This project is draining, even when I'm not working on it. Which is hopefully going to go away as I just get used to it.

Goodnight
