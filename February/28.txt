Feb 28th,

So my ip was unbanned by leetcode.com. Nice.

Today, I went back into the same problem as yesterday.

I hate to say it, but I looked up a solution after a while.

Not gonna lie, I learned how to do this problem all the way back in highschool.

So my math and cs teachers would not be proud.

Because it was literally the same conversion as binary.

Just you have to take into account the negative remainders when dividing by -2.

First, you have to actually add 1 to the division, because negative numbers round down in integer math. (And it needs to round towards zero for real math)

A negative remainder is the correct digit, just negative. So you absolute value it.

Good day gents
