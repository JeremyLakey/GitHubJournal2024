Apr 8th,

Being tired is a weird thing. Sometimes I feel tire more when waking up than sleeping.

I'm more tempted to stream some of the stuff I'm doing. I did it on friday/saturday.

Not very great at streaming and I don't have a perfect setup.

But I really like to pretending I'm talking to someone.

Which is the tone of this whole journal. 

In other notes, I'm working more on the turning machine documentation for the client.

I'm very very close, but I need to test some more things to make it developer friendly. 

Having second thoughts on the return objects and things of different functions.

After this project, I have of course the ai projects, mudcraft, and the recipe parser.

But somewhere somehow, I want to pivot hard to doing unreal engine game development. Because I want to get do a 3-D game for a game Jam this year.

And actually learning an engine can take months. 

I waasss learning godot and half of the side projects I started was godot.

But I think 3D will be more of challenge.

Bye
