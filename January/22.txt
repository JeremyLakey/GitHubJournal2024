Didn't have time to work too much today. Helped my brother learn git and c++.

I started looking more into javascript terminal stuff for mud craft. I wrote it in a different repository, because I don't want to get distracted by the specifics of mud craft.

Hopefully I'll write a tool that works well enought that I can erase the terminal quickly, but still update use input.

Good day gents
