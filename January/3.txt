Got a little distracted today and wrote about 800 lines for the turning machine api.

Writing the rules was a fun exercise, but I probably need to write some tests.

With so many rules, it would be best to ensure each of them work as intended.

Also the majority of git projects don't write tests. So its a subtle flex to do so.
