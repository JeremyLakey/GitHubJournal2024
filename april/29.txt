Apr 29th,

Unreal scares me. So I decided to avoid until I actually got to my computer tonight.

I decided to just play around and I ended up making a platform with a little toggling light bulb.

Tomorrow I might try to make the platform move back and forth.

Overall, I'm feeling way better about Unreal after tonight.

Not anywere near a compent level. But somewhere.

bye!
