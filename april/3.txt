Apr 3rd,

Still working on a dumb ai project.

I'm mostly curious what happens when you build little memories and inject into prompts.

The idea probably has been done, but the method of selection will somewhat be like spell check.

It will be fun to get something going that is somewhat more human of a chat bot.

Most ai people will tell you that ai is creative. And I don't feel it.

It feels very generic. And I would like my ai to be better at chatting than most.

More so for a game application than a company tool.

But I don't expect anything out of this.

Bye!
