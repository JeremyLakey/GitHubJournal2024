Feb 23rd,

I actually took time to write a great journal entry, but accidently hit no on save.

So it is forever lost.

But I finished some tests I was putting off.

I've been letting fear creep up in this project.

Which is resulting in extra stress. So my counter measure is planning less what I program each night.

Have a good night!
