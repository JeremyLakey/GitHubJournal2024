May 26th,

Feeling off today about working, but then I started working and it worked out.

Implemented one command in mudcraft and reduced the chance a entity below gound or in the sky is rendered. 

Really basic stuff today, because I had very little time, but we grooving a bit.

For some reason, I keep getting a nervous feeling about the project, but I'm just keep finding joy while working on it.

I think it's the how will this feel once everything is said and done.

Will it fun to play? (I don't know)

Will it be cancerous to even do the most basic things? (Maybe or maybe not)

Will skeletons snipe the player outside of their vision? (Yes, yes they will)

But I'm still just so excited to see it pan out a little bit more each day.

Bye
