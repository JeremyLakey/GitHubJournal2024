May 22nd,

I wrote the may 21st entry on the 21st, I forgot to commit it thou. Oops.

But Today I got digging working in Mudcraft!

Probably going to do more inventory managment stuff then placing blocks next.

But it is wicked cool to be able to manipulate the world through the terminal.

After that, I'll try to get ladders, doors, chest, and villagers working.

Then lastly attacking.

And then you cannot forget crafting.

Which I don't think will be as hard as it sounds. But it will still be pretty hard.

Alright go away now
