Jan 13th,

I just worked on a few tests. And I didn't work much today.

But I'm planning a murder mystery party, and that took a lot of my time.

Also, I had a great run in slay the spire that took up a large portion of my day.

Lastly, making korean fried chicken for my family took the second half of the day.

So all of this combined, I think editting 13 tests was rather good. But I didn't get to stream as according my schedule.

Overall, It could have gone better. But code is code.


I wonder if I'm getting to complacent in writting these tests. Tomorrow I'm not gonna work on any more tests, but the api.

Hopefully that makes me feel more productive and more motivating. But working on something like a godot game, which I now little is also dis hearting.

Maybe it is time to change between projects more, and just accept that the pace of starting a project is not mantainable.
