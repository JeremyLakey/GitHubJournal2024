Mar 22nd,

Got to writting the documentation today. Or atleast a third of it.

Which is probably plenty for each day.

I also spend sometime while doing that to actually go over each endpoint.

The thought has repeditately crossed my mind to work on a new project.

But I'm not sure what that should be. 

There is a weird guilty feeling I get after hyperfocusing on a project for months.

But to be honest, atleast I'm finishing projects.

So maybe this is all fine and dandy.

Bye
