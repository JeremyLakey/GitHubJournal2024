Mar 13th,

I have had a great day, and hope you have had one too.

The example bot for the turning machine api is going grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat.

Hopefully, I'll have it complete by tomorrow and then I can start writting the api.

After some final testing, I'll be maybe exporting the api as a node module to make the experience easy for developers.

Then I might add a frame work for hosting a tournament. 

We'll see what I do with it, but I will like to do more mudcraft stuff first.

Bye
