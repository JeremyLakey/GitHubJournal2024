Apr 11th,

Today might have been the biggest mistake.

Django for python is terrible.

Mostly because it generates a big project instead of just letting have my back-end server.

The crazy thing about python frame-works is they always seem to try and do both front-end and back-end.

Which causes this big blot when I just want the back-end section.

It's kinda trash.

And I might revert my changes for the recipe parser, I hate it that much.

Bye!
