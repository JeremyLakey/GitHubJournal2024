May 30th,

Almost at the end of the month, but we are almost half way done with the year!

Today was refactoring my working proof of concept into a format that will allow me to continually tweek Twitch plays clash royale.

But I'm not very far along and I'm motivated to keep working tonight.

Which is strange, because I have to clean the house and can't spend any more time.

I'm almost more fraustrated by having motivation and not being able to act on it.

But laters
