Apr 30th,

Actually the last day of April.

Went back and messed around in unreal for a minute.

Not gonna lie. I kinda hate the node system of programming, because it doesn't feel like programming.

Stupid I know.

But that what I get for trying new things. New things.

Of course it isn't a bad system. I'm just fighting it and feeling dumb.

So it's like normal programming, but with more search bars and component specific knowledge.

SO it's a bit closer to learning a code base than it is to programming.

It's kinda like learning css or html for the first time (But better because that is another all time low learning moment)

To offset the feeling of "not coding" I'm probably going to either a) code more other stuff on top of unreal stuff. or b) switch more often.

But to be fair, I'm making progress and it's not feeling as bad as learning Scala.

Which is a bonus. (That is still the lowest low I have ever felt from the programming language).

Ok, I don't have much else to say. Night
