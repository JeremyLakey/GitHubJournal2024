June 30th,

Started working on a read me. Which is what I like to do on Sundays.

It just less stress and feels rewarding.

The project it is for, Clash Royale Twitch plays, is very very hard to set up.

And didn't even finish after a while. 

The next step for the read me, is working on the hotkey setup for battles.

And also getting images for selecting cards.

It's most time consuming stuff. 

Tomorrow will be more testing to try to get card placing working more properly. There is a really really high chance of failure that needs fixing.

Bye
