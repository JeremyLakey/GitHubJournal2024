May 21st,

I've had the biggest desire to stream something today, but then I figured out my streaming software is being deprecated.

So I decided to not. Out of sadness.

But instead, I added digging to mudcraft. (Haven't testing it yet)

In theroy, the logic should be straight forward. 

But there is always some bugs here or there.

So, I'll work it out eventually after some better testing.

I'm just too tired today and want to sleep.

Bye
