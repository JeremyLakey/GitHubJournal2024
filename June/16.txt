June 16th,

No thoughts today.

But I decided to try to implement help prompts to clash royal project.

Nothing serious, just when a user sends help, I'll direct them to a web page (or eventually a youtube video).

Also, I found a few other typos and bugs.

I'm 89% sure this isn't in a working state, because I just keep working on the project without testing and QAing anything.

But it will probably be fine.... I hope.

Bye
