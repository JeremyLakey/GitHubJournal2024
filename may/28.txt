May 28th,

I've been tired alllll day today.

Then I was excited to start coding and then it I started working on oauth.

Day ruined.

I got some code down but didn't figured it out before my head ran out of steam.

I was just trying to connect a bot to a twitch chat and there seems to be a lot more security protocals that have been added over the last 6 months or something.

Because I don't remember it being this cancerous. Or I'm just doing the wrong thing. Maybe tomorrow will be the day it all works. Or maybe not.

N'ght
