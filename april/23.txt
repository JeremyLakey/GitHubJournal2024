Apr 23rd,

I did something sub optimal.

Leetcode

I know, terrible terrible waste of my time.

But there is something very satisfying about solving leet code problems in scala.

Because over a year ago when I was first learning scala, even a simple easy problem took me hours and I didn't even solve it.

So I'm some what riding a high. 

To be honest, I kinda want to do my next interview in scala. Or atleast be interview ready in the language.

I consider myself interview ready in python, almost in c++/javascript, and now almost in scala. 

Instead of power tripping and show boating, I should've taken time today to learn unreal or more godot. But I just didn't want to learn today.

Other things I thought about were 1. project Mudcraft and 2. Discord Recipe bot.

For the recipe bot, I could have refactor some code and added subfolders. 

Maybe even a table of context file that is auto updated the new files. (For quick navigation)

Ok, I'm giving up for the night, bye
