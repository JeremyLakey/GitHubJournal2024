Mar 6th,

Desk is finished, so back to coding.

But I'm leaving on vacation tomorrow and will likely not write more code this week.

I decided to start writting the example bot for the turn machine api.

Next, I'll write some documentation for the api itself, then consider the project done.

Hoooooooooooooooooope your day is great!
