May 29th,

Ok, I don't like how the twitch auth works.

But that is mostly because I'm not very good at authorizations.

It took me an hour of developing reading comprehension skills, but I think we are in business to start working on the twitch plays clash project.

The last thing to look into tomorrow is going a more proper event loop.

Bye
